notes:
- Have you ever taken something apart - a lamp? a computer?
- You were (hopefully) able to put it back together because you saw how it started.
- Demos have the same effect.
- Users can pick apart and visualize everything you've explained.
- make them real, relevant
- double check syntax

Demos provide a *starting point* for users.
