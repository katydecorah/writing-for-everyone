notes:
-  Why this talk?
-  Have you ever read a book, but couldn't get through the first chapter. Perhaps the author has a strong vocabulary or your couldn't follow the story. Maybe you tried to get through it, but unless it was compulsory you probably gave up because if this *first chapter* is tough then the rest of the book will be too.
-  Writing has that effect, whether it's a tutorial, a tweet, a blog post, or a README - it's all the same. If you box out users with thick jargon or indirect language  then they'll be afraid of your tools, API, or your blog.
- We write and document, to share
-  To me, clear writing is welcoming.
-  It's using plain language and active voice to make sure your audience can follow along.

Clear writing is *welcoming*.
